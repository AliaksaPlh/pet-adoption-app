      'Taya was born where she was not expected, in a place where only the strongest survive. Thanks to kind people, she grew up and became a beauty. Taya knows what it means to be unwanted — she is happy to receive affection and kind words. She is ready to follow commands, just needs a bit of teaching. She is one of those dogs who would follow her owner to the ends of the earth. Young, playful, energetic, people-oriented, great with children and other animals. She is beautiful, graceful, and has a kind personality. All that’s left is to find her a loving family! If Taya has caught your heart, come meet her — she’s waiting for you!',
